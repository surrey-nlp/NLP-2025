I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.')"

If I was loading up a time capsule of this period both these series would definitely go in.<br /><br />Someone watching it for the first time will think it is silly but this is one of the best examples of the \"Serials\". Don Del Oro will make you laugh (When I was little my nickname for him was Mr Dustbin head) and it was funny upon being shot at he says \"Your bullets can't harm me\" then he stumbles back, seemingly less than happy. I also like the way he dispenses with Sebastian in the first episode.<br /><br />I watched this again because I had good memories of it from years back, there are some good stunts and good music, it has the ingredients you expect including water,rockfalls,runaway carts... Apart from the first episode(with Ralph Faulkner)the swordplay wasn't nearly as good as I remembered it, and yes it features the inevitable \"flashback\" episode! It gets 8 out of 10 because it still suffers from slow pace, padding and the other tricks. If you are interested in these serials I recommend the book by William Witney, \"In a Door, Into a Fight, Out a Door, Into a Chase\" although there is only a small entry about this series in it.\n",

This embedding layer is simply a single fully connected layer. As well as reducing the dimensionality of the input to the RNN, there is the theory that words which have similar impact on the sentiment of the review are mapped close together in this dense vector space.

That is a batch of sentences, each having each word converted into its vocabulary index in our previous processing steps. The act of converting a list of tokens into a list of indexes is commonly called *numericalizing*. The `Embedding` layer will take care of converting these indices into one-hot vectors. Note that `batch_sentence_length` is the length of the largest sentence in the batch.\n",

We will use these lengths to essentially remove the padding present in each sentence into the batch, and combine all sentences into one large vector that will get fed through the RNN. This is mainly a performance optimization but it is generally good practice. Note that even if we are combining all our input into one continuous tensor, the RNN will still output results for individual sentences, the main thing we gain is that we don't waste computation time processing the padding present in the original tensors.\n",

Since we're using packed padded sequences, `output` will also be a packed padded sequence, so its size will be slightly different and overall smaller the normal size.\n",
