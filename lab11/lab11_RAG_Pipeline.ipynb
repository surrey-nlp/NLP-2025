    "\n",
    "There are frameworks such as [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) and [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) that makes building this pipeline easy; however, the goal of this lab is to learn how the individual parts work."

    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was introduced in the paper [*Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step can be roughly broken down to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retrieval** - Seeking relevant information from a source given a query. For example, getting relevant passages of Wikipedia text from a database given a question.\n",
    "* **Augmented** - Using the relevant retrieved information to modify an input to a generative model (e.g. an LLM).\n",
    "* **Generation** - Generating an output given an input. For example, in the case of an LLM, generating a passage of text given an input prompt."

    "## Why RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of RAG is to improve the generation outptus of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two primary improvements can be seen as:\n",
    "1. **Preventing hallucinations** - LLMs are incredible but they are prone to potential hallucination, as in, generating something that *looks* correct but isn't. RAG pipelines can help LLMs generate more factual outputs by providing them with factual (retrieved) inputs. And even if the generated answer from a RAG pipeline doesn't seem correct, because of retrieval, you also have access to the sources where it came from.\n",
    "2. **Work with custom data** - Many base LLMs are trained with internet-scale text data. This means they have a great ability to model language, however, they often lack specific knowledge. RAG systems can provide LLMs with domain-specific data such as medical information or company documentation and thus customized their outputs to suit specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the original RAG paper mentioned above outlined these two points in their discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This work offers several positive societal benefits over previous work: the fact that it is more\n",
    "strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\n",
    "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",
    "employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benefit to society, for example by endowing it\n",
    "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",
    "effective at their jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG can also be a much quicker solution to implement than fine-tuning an LLM on specific data.\n"

    "We'll write the code to:\n",
    "1. Open a PDF document (you could use almost any PDF here).\n",
    "2. Format the text of the PDF textbook ready for an embedding model (this process is known as text splitting/chunking).\n",
    "3. Embed all of the chunks of text in the textbook and turn them into numerical representation which we can store for later.\n",
    "4. Build a retrieval system that uses vector search to find relevant chunks of text based on a query.\n",
    "5. Create a prompt that incorporates the retrieved pieces of text.\n",
    "6. Generate an answer to a query based on passages from the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the structure we'll follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's similar to the workflow outlined on the NVIDIA blog which [details a local RAG pipeline](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/rag-101-demystifying-retrieval-augmented-generation-pipelines/).\n",

    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is another way of saying \"given a query, search for relevant resources and answer based on those resources\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's breakdown each step:\n",
    "* **Retrieval** - Get relevant resources given a query. For example, if the query is \"What is the passing mark?\" the ideal results will contain information regarding the exam or degree passing mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Augmentation** - LLMs are capable of generating text given a prompt. However, this generated text is designed to *look* right. And it often has some correct information, however, they are prone to hallucination (generating a result that *looks* like legit text but is factually wrong). In augmentation, we pass relevant information into the prompt and get an LLM to use that relevant information as the basis of its generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generation** - This is where the LLM will generate a response that has been flavoured/augmented with the retrieved resources. In turn, this not only gives us a potentially more correct answer, it also gives us resources to investigate more (since we know which resources went into the prompt).\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole idea of RAG is to get an LLM to be more factually correct based on your own input as well as have a reference to where the generated output may have come from."
