The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture has significantly advanced the field of NLP by enabling the development of powerful and versatile language models. Its transformer-based design, coupled with unsupervised pre-training on large text corpora, has revolutionized tasks such as text generation, summarization, and language understanding.\n",
