        "With the vast amount of work done in the LLM domain today, it helps to have a tool that people can use easily to share their results and use to check others to ensure reported numbers are valid. The LM Evaluation Harness is one such tool the community has used extensively. We want to continue to support the community and with that in mind, we’re excited to announce a major update on the LM Evaluation Harness to further our goal for open and accessible AI research.\n",

Moreover, it has direct integration with Huggingface's datasets and Transformers APIs, making it extremely simple to use open source models and data for these evaluations."

By leveraging the YAML configs to configure evaluations, the refactored LM-Eval takes the methods of the `Task` object and makes them configurable by setting the appropriate attributes in the config file. There, users can set the tasks they want by setting the name of the HF dataset (local tasks are also possible), the dataset splits used, and much more. Key configurations relating to prompting, such as `doc_to_text`, previously implemented as a method of the same name, are now configurable with jinja2 to allow high-level scripting to transform a HF dataset to text string as input to the model.\n",
